# Transaction AI Summary Implementation

## Overview
The transaction explainer now shows the AI summary first and most prominently, using real Sui blockchain data to generate natural language explanations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **AI Summary First** ü§ñ
- The AI explanation now appears at the top of the transaction embed
- Highlighted with a special box design and robot emoji
- Uses larger, more prominent text styling
- Shows before technical details like gas usage and operations

### 2. **Real Blockchain Data** üîó
- Integrated with actual Sui RPC to fetch real transaction data
- Parses transaction operations, move calls, and participants
- Identifies protocols and smart contract interactions
- Generates context-aware explanations based on actual transaction content

### 3. **Improved API Structure** üõ†Ô∏è
- Created `transaction-explorer.ts` for fetching real transaction data
- Updated `gemini-service.ts` with proper data structures
- Enhanced fallback explanations with better protocol detection
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for transaction data

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience** ‚ú®
- Toggle button to show/hide transaction embeds
- Loading states while fetching data
- Caching to avoid repeated API calls
- Copy functionality for transaction digests
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: When a message contains a transaction digest, the toggle button appears
2. **Data Fetching**: Real transaction data is fetched from Sui blockchain
3. **AI Processing**: Transaction data is analyzed to generate natural language explanation
4. **Display**: AI summary is shown prominently at the top, followed by technical details
5. **Caching**: Results are cached to improve performance

## API Integration

- **Transaction Explorer**: Fetches real transaction data from Sui RPC
- **Gemini Service**: Generates AI explanations (currently using fallback, ready for API key)
- **Protocol Detection**: Identifies known DeFi protocols and smart contracts
- **Address Resolution**: Maps addresses to human-readable names where possible

## Testing

Use the test cases in `TRANSACTION_TEST.md` to verify:
- Transaction detection works with various digest formats
- AI summary appears first and is prominently displayed
- Toggle functionality works correctly
- Real blockchain data is fetched and displayed
- Error handling works for invalid transactions

## Next Steps

1. Add your `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file for AI explanations
2. Test with real Sui transaction digests
3. Verify the AI summary appears first and is easy to read
4. Check that technical details are shown below the summary
