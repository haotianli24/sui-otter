# React Hooks Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing a "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error. This is a violation of React's Rules of Hooks, which states that hooks must be called in the same order on every render.

## Root Cause
In `MessagesPage.tsx`, hooks were being called conditionally:
1. `useCurrentAccount()` was called
2. Early return if no account (violating hook order)
3. `useMessaging()` was called (only if account exists)
4. `useSessionKey()` was called separately (creating a duplicate call since `useMessaging` already calls it internally)

## Solution
Following the pattern from the working `otter-chat` example:

### 1. Call ALL hooks unconditionally at the top of the component
```typescript
function MessagesPageContent() {
    // ✅ ALL hooks called first, unconditionally
    const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount();
    const { sessionKey, isInitializing, initializeManually, error } = useSessionKey();
    const {
        channels,
        messages,
        sendMessage,
        fetchMessages,
        isReady,
        createChannel,
        isCreatingChannel,
    } = useMessaging();
    
    // ✅ State hooks also called unconditionally
    const [selectedChannelId, setSelectedChannelId] = useState<string | undefined>();
    const [showCreateChannel, setShowCreateChannel] = useState(false);
    const [recipientAddress, setRecipientAddress] = useState("");
    const [createChannelError, setCreateChannelError] = useState<string | null>(null);
    
    // ✅ NOW conditional rendering happens AFTER all hooks
    if (!currentAccount) {
        return <WalletConnectionPrompt />;
    }
    
    if (!sessionKey) {
        return <SessionInitializationPrompt />;
    }
    
    // ... rest of component logic
}
```

### 2. Proper Provider Wrapping
```typescript
export default function MessagesPage() {
    return (
        <ErrorBoundary>
            <SessionKeyProvider>
                <MessagingClientProvider>
                    <MessagesPageContent />
                </MessagingClientProvider>
            </SessionKeyProvider>
        </ErrorBoundary>
    );
}
```

## Key Takeaways

### React Rules of Hooks
1. **Always call hooks at the top level** - Never inside conditions, loops, or nested functions
2. **Call hooks in the same order every time** - React relies on hook call order to maintain state
3. **Don't call hooks after conditional returns** - This changes the number of hooks called

### Working Pattern (from otter-chat)
```typescript
function Component() {
    // 1. Call ALL hooks first (unconditional)
    const hook1 = useHook1();
    const hook2 = useHook2();
    const [state, setState] = useState();
    
    // 2. Then do conditional rendering
    if (condition) return <EarlyReturn />;
    
    // 3. Then rest of logic
    return <MainContent />;
}
```

### What NOT to Do
```typescript
function Component() {
    const hook1 = useHook1();
    
    // ❌ WRONG: Early return before all hooks are called
    if (condition) return <EarlyReturn />;
    
    // ❌ This hook won't be called when condition is true
    const hook2 = useHook2();
}
```

## Files Modified
- `/Users/dhiyaan/code/sui-otter/otter-webapp/src/pages/MessagesPage.tsx` - Fixed hook ordering
- `/Users/dhiyaan/code/sui-otter/otter-webapp/vite.config.ts` - Changed port to 3000

## Verification
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Dev server running on port 3000
- ✅ All hooks called in consistent order

## Reference
The fix was based on the working implementation in:
- `archived/otter-chat/src/App.tsx` (lines 9-27)
- `archived/messaging-sdk-example/src/hooks/useMessaging.ts`
